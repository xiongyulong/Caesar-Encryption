# Caesar-Encryption
Encrypt or decrypt a text using Caesar method. For example, when encrypted, 'C' is changed to 'F', 'x' is changed to 'a'.

# HOW TO USE IT
I recommend you to compile kaisa.c to kaisa(an executable file) in UBUNTU or other system with installed GCC tools.
Maybe you can use this instruction in command line: `gcc -o kaisa kaisa.c`
